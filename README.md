An application built around the Marvel API.
It allows the user to see creators, comics, series and characters.

Technologies used:
- Node.js to hide Public and Private keys, in addition to this I've used Jest to test the different API endpoints. More info here: https://github.com/allden/marvel-api
- React and the react-router-dom module
- SCSS for styling
- Krita for the banner images
- Figma for the design prototype
- HTML Markup to structure the webpage

I did my best to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by separating the different elements into components, 
same goes for my SCSS files.
